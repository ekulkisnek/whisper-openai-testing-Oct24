 Okay, awesome. There we go. We got the recording block in the voice channel.
 Alright, I'll just start.
 talking, um, let me think. What have I been experimenting with lately? Um, it's been mostly.
 my usual routine in like just getting sun immediately the moment that I wake up and then in regards to herbs I've been really
 focusing on maximizing essentially mostly dopamine just so I can get as much work done throughout the day as possible because I've been working on getting a new
 shipment to our oh my bad sorry if you heard that alarm let me turn those off real quick I've been working on getting a new shipment sent to the fulfillment center for Grimspoth to carry
 And there's been very time consuming with trying to balance that between taking care of my family when they were sick. They're finally feeling better, which is. It's been a major relief.
 on my shoulders but it is what it is it's life yeah I learned that it's just been the same
 Some might expose myself to the natural weather, depending on the season. So, it's been mostly cold. There's been like, we'll get a week here and there of sun and warmth and then...
 immediately goes to cloudy and fold. So I've just been swapping between that. It's been nice, but I'm just looking forward to the regular sun in warmth that comes with, or should be coming with...
 Let me check the... Okay, so we got some questions rolling in. Yes, asked.
 Oh, hold on, we respond to this decky guy. Let's see here.
 Okay. Which herbs are your favorite for dopamine agonism?
 um lately i've been utilizing uh... potu-abba bark blue lotus marappuama as like the foundation and then the supporting urbe
 are things like Sumerute, Luthiro. I've been really enjoying that sabroxy herbal extract from a roxilum in the come that no tropis depot provides.
 has, I believe it's called a Roxle and A as the primary constituent. It's been very useful. It's been very useful. It's like it's very similar to Kato Abu Bak in the
 that it's like a very pure dopamine reuptake inhibitor but it also has some very mild GABA GABA A
 negative allosteric modulation. So it reduces the sensitivity to GABA, to the receptors. So it's, it can be a little bit angiogenic or anxiety-induced.
 in some people that are more sensitive, but that's balanced out by the bicaillin and bicellin, which are gabbit positive alosteric modulators. So they resensitize gabbit receptors to
 your induction is gamma. Aside from that, I've been really enjoying that, it's a usual in my stack is the,
 The pagan of harm all that I usually put into my herbal coffee Hold on let me pull up the I still take notes of my intake just out of habit
 So my herbal coffee has My herbal coffee has been blue lotus butterfly pee Chinese cats claw Chinese school cat
 FOTE lemon meriddle, which is a... it's like an anabolic herb that I've been experimenting with a little bit. I'll probably write more about it. I found some studies in rodents where it increases the...
 satellite cells in the muscles, which is the potential for growth in the muscles. So that's been... It seems to be effective, but it's not like a steroid obvious...
 The Muayra Puama, the Katsuo of Babark, Polygala, Porya Mushroom is something else that I've been experimenting with for kidney health and blood pressure regulation. Serien.
 and Woodbethney so the pharmacologist kind of all over the place with my herbal coffee but it balances itself out fairly well. That's pretty much the uh...
 the gist of the the herbal stack that I've been working with it's a little complex because there's so many regulatory pathways to inhibiting like full dopamine potential.
 wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it can make people, it can make some people manic, but that it hasn't been the case for me because of the more calming and regulatory herbs that I include.
 And how goes the experimentation with the lithium metaborate? So this one I've had.
 the compound for a very long time and then I finally made a solution with it and it's essentially it's just a mix between lithium and boron. There's nothing really unique about it in the sense that
 Like there's no unique effects compared to taking either one separate. It just makes it a little bit more convenient. So it's... The combination of it, I believe, is very effective for...
 kidney protection. It's very effective in stimulating stem cells for specific parts of the body, like lithium in general, and then with the boron attachment, it's very effective for
 the skeletal system, the kidneys, the pituitary gland, the hormones. Yeah, it's been useful, but like I said, I...
 first human. I'm aware of it has uh, trialled it so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it compared to just taking either one separately. Weird obscure issue on trying to figure out.
 Went through a ton of what I believe now is the dreamless stress last year and my whole life really and during the worst episode I seem to grow a ton of body hair I also develop a lot of dandruff on my scalp and hair loss. What do you think the mech?
 for this happening, any advice on getting my body back to homeostasis other than addressing knee journals? No one's a little bit tricky with...
 With body hair, I've noticed dihydro testosterone or DHT and then elevated thyroid hormones, which can become elevated with stress.
 infections so like if you were sick around that period it it it got it ties back to what I was talking about with youth thyroid sick syndrome on the Twitter
 timeline recently where it elevates your thyroid stimulating hormone but without really messing around with like T3 or T4. So that will have a
 downstream effect on elevating the other thyroid hormones and then that can also cause an increase in body hair. From the dandruff on the scalp and hair loss that's um...
 It really depends on the patterning for the hair loss, like if it's on the crown that could be related to Portozole, Perlactin, and then D- I believe D-H-T.
 rises in response to other stressors rather than being the root cause of the hair loss. And then
 If it's like, hair fall coming from anywhere else on the scalp, not just the crown, it could be telogen effluvium, which is a response to stress on the body, which generally passes
 the time, but like a nutritional surplus in stress management can mitigate a lot of that. That's for the dandruff. Like stress in general, the adrenal stress can...
 have a negative impact on the gut microbiota and thus the skin microbiota but I would also be looking at your like if you don't have a shower filter that can be very helpful changing the
 sheets in the pillowcases regularly, just basic advice for skin health, hair health. But the shower filter can make a big difference particularly if you live in a city.
 where the municipal tap water is not very optimal or like if you live in a, even if you live in a rural area with a lot of hard water that can have a negative impact on the...
 microbiome of the skin as well, which can result in some of that danger of issue. Yeah, it's very tough to say on a very specific cause for something like that without...
 further detail, but those are some Things off the top of my head. Yes, if you have anything that you'd like to include there then by all means



 Yeah, that would be an excellent addition as well as well as just like the impact on the
 skin microbiome in regards to UV light and specifically. All right, Decky said, are there any herbs which would be...
 in the context of this autonomia and sympathetic nervous system act over activation, gabber herbs, dopamine herbs, etc. So yeah, in general, I did a...
 very in-depth outline on the a lot of calming and sedative herbs in the I believe it was the Gabba Urgent drug drug recovery protocol ignore the drug
 part, like if you're not tapering off any relevant substances, but there's a very in-depth review on not just the herbal medicines, but nutrient co-factors as well that can be of great help.
 in regards to dis autonomia and sympathetic nervous system over activation. And then, like ES said, just general lifestyle changes that are congruent with stress management.
 So like trying to mitigate your day to day stress it to the greatest extent possible would be very helpful in some cases that's very difficult to do like if you live in a A stressful home like the
 the relationship environment is not very optimal or a very high-stress job. You'll still want to try to increase your stress management factors in that regard just because...
 You don't want to worsen the situation, but like the nutritional and herbal support and lifestyle support will be of great help in that regard. Okay.
 I've seen Matthew said I've seen your tweets on neurogenesis where you talk about dialing in inocenthal intake, lithium intake and various herbal preparations for stem cell development.
 are those the ones outlined in the Gabba Rijik recovery protocols? Haven't found as much detail on Twitter from searching things. Yeah, so I've essentially
 I believe I've outlined them in the majority of like the GABA support protocols in general. I think the dopamine support protocols and then the...
 like the whole chapter series of the, what was it called? The drug recovery protocols were outlined for a very...
 specific receptor systems. So the GABA-ERGIC one is definitely going to be the most comprehensive in regards to like the full brain and the stem cell development doesn't only apply to the brain, but the end.
 entire body. So every organ system within the body, including the mitochondria. Yeah, it's a fairly comprehensive process, but...
 The majority of it is going to be outlined in those protocols that I've written down. I may do a more direct approach on one of the articles if you guys are interested because I know some of the articles are...
 a little bit scattered. So if you have any requests for articles by all means, I'm currently editing one that I got a request for for a joint intended health that I've been experimenting with a little bit.
 because with the heavier lifting that I've been doing, I was dealing with some knee pain and sensitivity, but I'll let you guys read over the protocol, because it does.
 There were some other factors that I found were involved just aside from mechanical stress. What are the mobile, apothecary contents? Things you carry outside the house?
 Basically I'll carry the major electrolyte salts, so like sea salt, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride. Usually I'll carry a bottle of topical magnesium.
 spray as well, a bottle of the brain tonic because the applications for that can be very wide ranging for some people that, like if you encounter someone that's like freaking out in public and...
 they're open to like having a dropper, it can have a very profound effect on calming them. Or like at a party, if you're with friends, it's something like a context similar to that.
 My mentor talked about having a methuline blue on hand, but I haven't really found a use for that yet. I usually keep it with me when I
 go to the city specifically as like a prophylactic. I carry a small bottle of black seed oil. Like I ordered these little, like, pump spray containers.
 from Amazon just so I could keep some on hand when I go to New York City just because you got to try to support your immune system to the greatest extent possible in an environment like that. And then...
 Those are really going to be the main factors. I've been carrying the lock zone on me as well just because the situation with the opioid epidemic and the knee disease.
 being more potent opioid research chemicals than fentanyl is, being widespread on the market. Nowadays has been very concerning.
 So like my wife's mother is a nurse. She's been reporting that there's been overdoses that are not responsive to Narcan and they don't come back positive for fentanyl. So I had to tell
 that the governments aware of it, they published an article on it in October of 2023, I believe, but I don't think they've alerted any of the nurses or doctors.
 like nationwide yet. Hopefully they do because it's a they just need more Narcan to reverse that type of overdose. But yeah that's another thing that I I try to keep on hand. Yes.
 Do you have anything that you like to keep in your mobile party carry?


 if
 In major cities specifically, it's very akin to being surrounded by that much radiation. The radiation you would be surrounded by on a plane in regards to the jet lag protocol.
 had written a while back. The ubiquinol is very useful in mitigating a lot of that detriment to the mitochondria. Any recommended shower filters?
 Hold on, let me pull up. What was that one called? Let's see.
 I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.
 Oh, the one that I was using in Phoenix was the ultimate dual KDF shower filter.
 without head. So you can just include your own shower attachment for that one. So it is a little bit bulky. The price point, it was when I was...
 buying it. We have well water here now. So it's just the hard water that we need to manage with a water softener. But it may not
 eliminate chloramine completely but it does have very powerful effect on chlorine. The price point was about 150 to 175 if I recall. I'm not sure if it's still the same.
 I believe I posted a link to it in the year. The... I think it was a mitochondrial redox protocol.
 I forget the exact title but I believe I put a link in there for the dual KDF shower filter. Yes are you aware of any other shower filters that you've seen.

 for
 Yeah, we've built up a very comprehensive library in this Discord channel since the beginning of it. So if you...
 I don't mind the questions, but if you're someone inclined going back and searching may be helpful as well, if it hasn't already been answered then by all means.
 Okay, so you responded to those? Yeah, the thiamine is going to be very implicating the disauto-nomia. Oh, he's already on top of it all. Awesome.
 Alphide Thompson said, do you have any advice regarding anyone dealing with post-vax damage and long COVID? 24 have been dealing with Vax injury since 2021 and also long COVID now.
 My main issue with chest pain, cardiac chest pain, but no definitive diagnosis, but likely paracarditis with the way it represents POTS palpitations, heart flutters, MCAS, histamine issues.
 chronic GI issues tonight is what feels like autoimmune issues and had a positive I jammed for brilliant more. Okay, so that was probably a typo. I'm trying my best to do all the right things.
 but I'm struggling severely still bed and housebound. So I would just start with the basics with the foundation if you have an RD. With the environment that's going to be a major.
 factor, especially in regards to your EMF situation, because that can trigger or exacerbate or worsen the autoimmune symptoms, which...
 Like the MCAS, some GI issues can be worsened with autoimmune conditions, but in general aside from that, the... There.
 is an immune system support protocol in my Twitter pin thread. It should be towards the bottom, I believe. It's a gumrow.
 link. If you just enter zero, you can download it for free. It's like seven pages of information that covers the both long COVID and the vaccine injuries.
 to like the immune system, the multiple mechanisms involved. I had written a thread on Twitter about
 management. Let me see if I can find that quickly.
 Okay, so it was I had quoted a newspaper article that said cases of heart attack among youth on the rise
 COVID in 2022. It said monitor for iron access or deficiency. You want to maintain your zinc and copper balance preferably at a one-to-one.
 maintain sufficient magnesium, so about a 6 to 6.5 milligrams per desolid on an RBC magnesium test calcium sodium potassium intake
 Consume DHA and touring daily regularly because that's going to be very anti-diflimatory for the the heart specifically maintain sufficient thiamine intake. So thiamine deficiency can result.
 and not just neurological symptoms, but also cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. So there's multiple forms of berry berry or that's like the name for thiamine deficiency at berry berry.
 There's like wet Barry Barry I forget all the different names for them, but it's It it's covered under thiamine deficiency Regular sun exposure for vitamin D and
 And with MCAS, you want to try to focus mostly on foods, because I know that a lot of supplements and some herbs
 trigger some response in that regard, but it really depends on the individual sensitivity. So like just trying to focus on the foundational basics is going to be a major impact on
 in regards to essentially all those symptoms. Shut off artificial light after sunset to maintain the electronic and cortisol balance. So that's going to be another two major factors in regards to
 those symptoms like cortisol can be very anti-inflammatory and all the tonin as well. And then you want those on the natural circadian rhythm rather than spiking or dropping or just being low all the time.
 Consume sufficient vitamins A. Vitamin A is very important for the immune system just to keep it functioning properly without over activation. Vitamin E, vitamin K2, vitamin B.
 B2, vitamin B3, B6, biotin, full eight, and B12. Protective factors like black seed oil may be a benefit for the cardiovascular system.
 with glycine and vitamin C may also be of benefit there. The aspirin can be a little bit of an issue for people with cell...
 sili sensitivity, but cell siliates are eliminated by the glycine detox pathway. So that's why I always recommend having a little bit of glycine if you ever take aspirin. Exercise becomes important.
 Once the nutrition we repeated as it does strengthen the cardiovascular system over exertion should be avoided in the meantime It's because you don't want to put Stress on an inflamed heart until it's managed a little bit better
 like obviously going for walks and everything but like sprinting extremely heavy lifting where you're going like 100% intensity exercise in general should be
 very important, but you'll want to try to get those foundational factors in place before you do so just so your body's able to handle any of that stress. And then just like the active stress management,
 and also becomes important with GABA support, breathing practice, so prana-yama or breath work, minimizing stressors and life and environment, so it's gonna be highly individual there. Maintaining metabolic health.
 is also extremely important through dietary lights, circadian grounding and lifestyle exercises, exercise practices. The black seed oil in an acetal can also be very helpful in supporting better bowel health.
 But they should they should be used as tools rather than bandages. So the inausital is very helpful in regulating insulin and leptin and then
 bleeding blood glucose levels as well if those are elevated or low. So it keeps them very stable. And then the gut microbiome is obviously going to be a major factor. But if you have symptoms of leaky gut,
 I would focus on managing that first with like Sunlight on the eyes and gut during the sunrise midday and sunset periods the
 Some people can be a little bit sensitive to things like bone broth. So I found meat stock or stews can be very helpful to get some of that glazing and glutamine into the digestive system a little bit better. A lot of...
 to seafood is going to be very not just anti-inflammatory but it'll have the amino acids necessary to repair the gut well.
 depending on the specific, you just mentioned GI issues. So depending on the specific symptoms, prebiotic starches can also be very helpful in regards to repopulating.
 butaric producing bacteria, which has a positive effect on the intestinal lining. And then the, I believe it's called the gut repair protocol. You may not need the full
 zero tolerance dietary framework unless like all of those factors trigger symptoms for you then by all means but there's a lot of good advice in there as well
 Yeah, that should cover a good amount. You want to try to target the foundation more so than individual symptoms because...
 You're just going to be playing a whack and roll pretty much in my experience. Whereas if you target the foundation a lot of those symptoms will subside on the wrong.
 are sprouted almonds okay as part of the zero tolerance dietator from yes the sprouting and
 I can't imagine fermentation would have them tasting very good, but sprouting is a very effective approach for that. That's a joint intending health would be good. I've got a recovering ECL now and I'm trying to...
 keep on trucking with my squat progression. Okay, awesome. Yeah. I'm almost finished with the treatment finally. It's been like a... It's been a crazy busy month. But yeah, I'll get that post as soon as possible.
 Yes, mention and drink a ridiculous amount of spring in mineral water while in cities. Drink probably 75% more than usual while in New York City. Oh man.
 It's such a stark difference in my water consumption and like how hydrate in my mouth will feel From upstate and then being in in the city I just feel
 like I can't drink enough water when I'm in the city just because the the EMF situation is just so dehydrating on the body and then as soon as I leave the city within a few hours to a day it
 It returns back to normal where I'm not just pounding down water all day constantly. It's a very noticeable difference. It's interesting to observe. What are your thoughts?
 nature boys said what are your thoughts on Sarasda Paryla and its benefits haven't been able to find much on your tutor. So Sarasda Paryla is it's more of a tonic and detox herb. I do include it in some of my herbal formulation.
 It's not something that I've talked about fairly often on Twitter or Patreon really. It's just more so something that I really enjoy the taste of. Like Jamaican, Sarsapro...
 is very tasty. It has like almost a sass of fresh taste like root beer. But yeah, it's good for the kidney health.
 It's more so like a tonic or for general sense of energy. I do find it helpful and again like I said it tastes incredible. I will...
 that it can cause a little bit of bowel flushing effect if you consume too much of it once. Pandro said one or two.
 Thank you, ES and Grim for holding these Q&A's you guys are amazing. Thank you very much. KDVS said I developed panic disorder a few months ago after an intensely painful experience.
 regular panic attacks, these episodes last for hours or days. I've been following the GABA protocols in zero tolerance for two months but progress is still slow. Then the other protocols I should be reviewing are things to look into. I saw you say...
 the GABA receptor system takes the longest to recover. Did you mean weeks to months are more like years? So without the support of neuroplasticity, the GABA receptor system,
 Like, for example, if you look at benzodiazepine recovery patients, some of them don't ever return to normal. That's because they are not aware of the importance.
 of nutritional surplus in regards to stress management and the cofactors needed for repairing the body. And then also they become very fearful of anything that has any room.
 So even things like magnesium, which would be very helpful in their situation, they no longer want anything to do with just because they are so afraid of like a potential.
 rebound effect, but in my experience really depends on like if it's just more of a recent experience and it just develops.
 in the last few months. It could be like a three to six month timeline, maximum, could be a couple of weeks that you start noticing major improvements. I couldn't imagine it's gonna be...
 years, unless it's like, I don't want to say like any specific context, but something extremely severe like someone passing away in front of your eyes, something in that regard.
 I'm very sorry if that's what happened, but yeah, it really depends on what exactly you've been following for the game.
 have a protocols because I've outlined a lot of detail in some of them and I don't expect people to follow everything like every single detail but
 the more that you can do the better in that regard. And then a lot of the herbal medicines are extremely helpful.
 friends that I have been joking about Maloon Gulbar on the Twitter timeline, but it was very helpful for one of my friends that was in a very similar situation where he started to develop.
 very severe panic attacks that again lasted for hours or days and maluga bark was very helpful in our regard. Magnolia bark and then just like the basic gabber herbs.
 Blue Lotus can be very helpful in integrating some of that magnesium, D&I, and woodbed knee. Oh, yeah, for the sympathetic nervous system activation question as well. Woodbed knee was very helpful.
 when I was dealing symptoms, very similar to that from CPTSD. That's a... It's an North American Commitive herb, so it has a pretty extent...
 of history but I've never really experienced any side effects hold on my can't keep rubbing up on me I've never experienced any side effects from wood Bentley but
 Some people can't experience a little bit of a low blood pressure. So just be aware of that if you struggle with any issues like that. But yeah, the neurogenesis in general will vastly speed up.
 the process of repairing the GABA receptor system just to summarize that whole rant. It shouldn't take years upon years like it normally would.
 Okay, yeah. So ES had linked the shower filter that's the ultimate dual KDF shower filter. That's the one that I had been using.
 There's very expensive shower filters, and that was the middle point that I had found and come across, rather than trying to invest a bunch of money into an apartment that I was living, or townhouse that I was living in.
 Um, Bell said I used to be in a similar position in panic text daily for days at a time and it definitely took a couple of years to start seeing tangible results. Yeah, it really depends on
 like, like PTSD versus CPTSD if it's just one single event. And then there's some factors that go into there. So like the state of the nervous system.
 and the body as a whole before that event occurred can play a major factor, but yeah, it can be very individual for sure.
 Yes, said a lot of issues like this can be a mix of psychological and biological. Yes, yes, it's very important as well. Where the psychological component of it is still present even after mineral, vitamin replacement and serp.
 Plus, it's important to work the trauma from the incident out. My favorite way is to sneak out the deeper meaning of the incident through getting in a safe, peaceful setting and praying about it or trying to release the fear of it happening again to God. Your wave.
 Handling it may be different, but if the core trauma is in dealt with, you will still experience the same symptoms until you become desensitized to the flashbacks in trauma. That's 100% accurate, especially in my experience as well.
 I've talked about here and there on the Twitter timeline, but that shadow work and working through a lot of that trauma is going to be very, very important. That can look different for everyone, so it doesn't always have to be a religious context.
 therapy can be helpful for some people breath work in pranayama some other therapy practices like khriniosacral therapy can have a very profound emotional release
 Some people require things like ketamine therapy that's perfectly fine. Yeah, yeah, he's 100% accurate in that regard. You'll want to try to work through things as you rebuild your foundation.
 Bell said, Pranayama and grounding is basically necessary for me at this point. There are a lot of herbs that have also been helpful too, but the psychological could
 The psychological component is massive. I'm sorry, you can late, but glad to hear you found relief. Thanks for that greatly appreciate it. Will this be recorded anywhere? Yes, yes.
 I'm gonna be making a... I'll probably post up an article just with like a Google Drive links. Just so... I don't think the Craigbot... ...saves.
 the audio files long term. So I just want it to be in a safer place before it gets deleted. um Deki, what are your thoughts on a chronic illness that just felt like it?
 just switched on instantly. Like within 10 minutes going from fine to chronically ill with the autonomic dysfunction shortness of breath, lightheaded and 24-7 symptoms. My question is, what mechanisms could be behind instant chronic illness? So it really depends on...
 the situation, the environment, the context of what was going on before that happened. I had dealt or I had been working with someone that dealt with a very very similar...
 situation, but it rains to like severe full body neuro like neuropathy like
 nervous system feeling like it's on fire constantly buzzing throughout the entire nervous system. He's made a full recovery but it took about took about a year. His situation was very very severe.
 with autonomic nervous system things, it typically doesn't take that long, but it really depends on the context. I would be looking at what the situation is.
 was at hand prior to that trying to target some of those and then just the same basic foundational advice really applies to any health condition and then also as a side note I would not
 just look internally, like within yourself or your life, but also look towards your environment. Like if there's any cell towers that go up, any 5G towers within your vicinity, on that's how you're building if you live in an apartment.
 complex, those can also have a very, very profound effect on your health and it can be like an instant switch, just feeling on top of the world one day and then
 just absolutely terrible the next. So that's going to be another factor that you want to look into. Mold is also another issue that can result in symptoms like that as well.
 So, Alfie Thompson said, I do quite a lot of the things you've suggested. I do seem to have some paradoxical reaction to some things that definitely try to implement everything. Yeah, with the MCAS.
 it makes things a little bit tricky. I'll go through my notes later today and then see if I'm pretty sure I worked with a client that had
 very severe MCAS and working on managing the histamine symptoms not just like very targeted nutrition and then some supplements that they had found they were
 for responsive to without any paradoxical reactions were helpful in that regard as well. But like I had mentioned earlier, the EMF situation, not just in...
 regards to mitochondrial function, but it also really is histamine from mass cells. So that's one of the reasons why I had mentioned it. It's a very common issue in regards to...
 Like people with the MCAS issue typically live in environments with a lot of EMF or major cities. That's not always the case, but it's something to be very mindful of.
 They all you're doing awesome. It's a really great feeling.
 Yeah, if you write about how do you realize everything that you were working with, I would be more than happy to share some of that because...
