 Okay, awesome. There we go. We got the reporting bot in the voice channel.
 There, I'll just start.
 Talking, let me think. What have I been experimenting with lately? It's been mostly...
 my usual routine in like just getting sun immediately the moment that I wake up and then in regards to herbs I've been really
 focusing on maximizing essentially, mostly dopamine just so I can get as much work done throughout the day as possible because I've been working on getting a new
 shipment to our full of my band. Sorry if you heard that alarm, let me turn those off real quick. I've been working on getting a new shipment sent to the fulfillment center for Grins' Pot, the carry.
 and uh... has been very time consuming with uh... trying to balance that between taking care of my family when they were sick they're fine with your own better which is uh... it's been a major relief
 phone my shoulders but it is what it is it's life yeah I look in that it's just been the same old same
 some might exposing myself to the natural weather depending on the season. So, they've been mostly cold, there's been like, we'll get a week here and there of sun in warmth and ended.
 immediately goes to cloudy and and fold. So I've just been swapping between that. It's been it's been nice, but I'm just looking forward to the regular sun in warmth that comes with or should be coming with.
 Let me check the, okay, so we got some questions rolling in. Yes, asked.
 Oh, hold on, respond to this decking guy. Let's see here.
 Okay, which herbs are your favorite for dopamine agnesin?
 um lately I've been utilizing uh patua babark blue lotus wear poema as like the foundation and then the supporting herb
 things like Sumerude, Luthiro, I've been, I've been really enjoying that subroxy herbal extract from MarACC.
 that has, believe it's called the Rocksley and A as the primary constituent. It's been, it's been very useful. It's been very useful. It's like it's very similar to Cato Abelbarc in the same.
 that it's like a very pure dopamine re-uptaken hip-it-er, but it also has some very mild overç–‘
 negative allosteric modulation. So it reduces the sensitivity to gather to the receptors. So it's it can be a little bit angiogenic or anxiety induced.
 and some people that are more sensitive, but that's balanced out by the bicaling and by saline which are gabbed, positive, alo-steric modulators. So they resensitized gabarice sectors too.
 your intoxicous camera. Aside from that, I've been really enjoying, that it's a usual in my stack is the out.
 You pegged them hard, maw, that I usually put into my herbal coffee. All that. Let me pull up the... I still take notes of my intake just out of habit.
 So my herbal coffee has My herbal coffee has been blue lotus butterfly P Chinese cats claw Chinese skull cat
 FOTY Lemon Merrill, which is a, it's like an anabolic herb that I've been experimenting with a little bit. I'll probably write more about it. I found some studies in rodents where it increases the, uh,
 I satellite cells in the muscles which is the potential for growth in the muscles. So that's been... It seems to be effective, but it's not like a steroid obvious.
 the Moer Puama, the Casuo Bavark, Polygala, Korea Mushroom is something else that I've been experimenting with for kidney health and blood pressure regulation. Syrian
 and wood bedney. So the the pharmacologist kind of all over the place with my herbal coffee, but it balances itself out fairly well. That's pretty much the uh...
 the gist of the herbal stack that I've been working with. It's a little complex because there's so many regulatory pathways to inhibiting full dopamine potential. I...
 wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it can make people suck. It can make some people manic, but it hasn't been the case for me because of the more calming and regulatory herbs that I include.
 And how goes the experimentation with the lithium, metabolic boreate? So this one I've had, like I've had.
 the compound for a very long time and then I finally made a solution with it and it's essentially it just a mix between lithium and boron. There's nothing really unique about it in the sense that uh
 Like there's no unique effects compared to taking either one separate it just makes it a little bit more convenient so it's the combination of it I believe is very effective for
 kidney protection. It's very effective in stimulating stem cells for specific parts of the body, like lithium and general, and then with the boron attachment, it's very effective for...
 the skeletal system, the kidneys, the pituitary gland, the hormones. Yeah, it's been useful, but like I said, I...
 first human. I'm aware of that has dried it so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it compared to just taking use of one separately. Weird obscure issue I'm trying to figure out.
 Went through a ton of what I believe now is a dreaml stress last year and my whole life really and During the worst episode, I seem to grow a ton of body here. I'll also develop a lot of danger of on my scalp and Hair loss. What do you think the mech?
 is them for this happening. Any advice on getting my body back to homeostasis other than addressing the neutrinos? No one's a little bit tricky with
 with body hair I've noticed die hydropatist astro or DHT and then like elevated thyroid hormones which can become elevated with a stretch.
 infections so like if you were sick around that period it got it ties back to what I was talking about with you thyroid sick syndrome on the Twitter
 timeline recently where it elevates your thyroid stimulating hormone but without really messing around with like T3 or T4. So that will have a...
 Downstream effect on elevating the other thyroid hormones and then that can also cause an increase in body hair. For the dandruff on the scalp and hair loss, that's...
 It really depends on the patterning for the hair loss like if it's on the crown that could be related to cortisol, for lack in and then d i believe d is t
 Lizes in response to other stressors rather than being the root cause of the hair loss. And then...
 If it's like a hair fall coming from any like everywhere else on the scalp, not just the crown, it could be a talogen effluvium which is a response to stress on the body with generally passes.
 the time, but like a nutritional surplus in stress management and Medicaid a lot of that. That's for the danger if stress in general, the adrenal stress can...
 have a negative impact on the gut microbiota and thus dust the skin microbiota but I would also be looking at your like if you don't have a shower filter that can be very helpful changing the
 sheets in the pillowcase is regularly just basic advice for like skin health, hair health. But like the shower filter can make a big difference, particularly if you live in a city.
 where the municipal tap water is not very optimal or like if you live in a even if you live in a rural area with a lot of hard water that can have a negative impact on the
 microbile move the skin as well, which can result in some of that danger of issue. Yeah, it's very tough to say on a very specific cause for something like that without.
 for their detail, but those are some things off the top of my head. Yes, if you have anything that you'd like to include there, then by all means.



 is well as just as well as just they
 skin microbiome in regards to like UV light and specifically. All right, Decky said are there any herbs which would be
 in the context of this autonomia and sympathetic nervous system overactivation, GABA herbs, dopamine herbs, etc. So, yeah, in general, I did a...
 very in depth outline on the a lot of calming and sedative herbs and the I believe it was the gab ergic drug drug recovery protocol ignored the drug
 like if you're not tapering off any relevant substances, but there's a very in-depth review on not just the herbal medicines, but new-train co-factors as well that can be of great help.
 in regards to disout an omia and sympathetic nervous system over activation. And then like ES said, just general lifestyle changes that are congruent with control.
 So like trying to mitigate your day-to-day stress to the greatest extent possible would be very helpful In some cases that's very difficult to do like if you live in a Stressful home like the
 the relationship environment is not very optimal or like a very high stress job. You'll still want to try to increase your stress management factors in that regard just because.
 You don't want to worse in the situation, but the like the nutritional and herbal support and lifestyle support will be of great help in that regard. Okay
 I've seen Matthew said I've seen your tweets on neurogenesis where you talk about dialing in an ossital intake, lithium intake, and various herbal preparations for stem cell development.
 or those the ones outlined in the GABA Rujic for February protocols, having found as much detail on Twitter from searching things. Yeah, so I've essentially...
 I believe I've outlined them in the majority of like the GABA support protocols in general. I think the dopamine support protocols and then the
 Like the whole chapter series of the, what is it called? The drug group of repubbery protocols were outlined for a very,
 specific receptor systems. So the the GABA Ergic one is definitely going to be the most comprehensive in regards to like the full brain and the stem cell development doesn't only apply to the brain but the end.
 entire body, so every organ system within the body, including the mitochondria. Yeah, it's a fairly comprehensive process, but...
 The majority of it is going to be outlined in those protocols that I've written down. I may do a more direct approach on one of the articles if you guys are interested, because I know some of the articles are...
 little bit scattered. So if you have any requests for articles by all means, I'm currently editing one that I got a request for for a joint intended health that I've been experimenting with a little bit.
 because with the heavier lifting that I've been doing, I was dealing with some knee pain and sensitivity, but... I like you guys read over the protocol, because it...
 There were some other factors that I found were involved just aside from mechanical stress. What did the mobile, pothochary contents? Things you'd carry on inside the house.
 Basically, I'll carry the major electrolytes salts, so like sea salt, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride. Usually I'll carry a bottle of top-colonine.
 sprays well, a bottle of the brain tonic because the applications for that can be very wide ranging for some people that like if you encounter someone that's like freaking out in public and
 they're open to like having a dropper, it can have a very profound effect on calming them. Or like that a party if you're with friends is something like a context similar to that.
 My mentor talked about having a methuline blue one hand, but I haven't really found a use for that yet. I usually keep it with me when I...
 go to the city specifically as like a prophylactic. I carry a small bottle of black cd oil like I ordered these little like pump spray containers.
 Amazon just so I could keep someone hand when I go to New York City just because You gotta try to support your immune system to the greatest extent possible in an environment like that and then
 Those are really going to be the main factors. I've been carrying the locks on on me as well just because the situation with the opioid epidemic and the need of the scenes.
 being more potent opioid research chemicals and fentanyl is. Being widespread on the market nowadays has been very concerning.
 So like my wife's mother is a nurse. She's been reporting that there's been overdoses that are not responsive to Narcan and they don't come back positive for fentanyl. So I had a tell
 that the governments aware of it, they published an article on it in October 2023, believe, but I don't think they've alerted any of the nurses or doctors.
 like nationwide yet. Hopefully they do because it's a they just need more narcan to reverse that type of overdose. But yeah that's that's another thing that I try to keep on hand. Yes.
 So you have anything that you like to keep in your mobile part of carry.


 I would definitely agree with those as well.
 In major cities specifically, it's very akin to being surrounded by that much radiation you would be surrounded by on a plane in regards to the jet lag protocol.
 written a while back, that you bickering all those very useful and mitigating a lot of that detriment to the mitochondria. Any recommended shower filters.
 Hold on, let me pull up. What was it one called? Let's see.
 I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.
 the one that I was using in in Phoenix was the ultimate dual KDF shower filter with
 without head. So you can just include the your own shower attachment for that one. So it is a little bit bulky. The price point was when I was...
 buying it. We have well water here now so it's just the hard water that we need to manage with the water softener but it may not
 eliminate chloramine completely, but it does have very powerful effect on chlorine. The price point was about 150 to 175, if I recall, I'm not sure if it's still the same.
 I believe I posted a link to it in the end. The... I think it was a mitochondrial redox protocol. Something of that nature.
 I figured the exact title, but I believe I put a link in there for the dual KDF shower filter. Yes, are you aware of any other shower filters that you've seen?

 Okay, perfect.
 Yeah, we built up a very comprehensive library in this discord channel since the beginning of it. So if you...
 I don't mind the questions, but if you're so inclined going back in searching may be helpful as well, if it has an already been answered and by all means.
 Okay, so you responded to those. Yeah, the thiamine is going to be very imprecated in the disout of Nomiya. Oh, he's already on top of it all. Awesome.
 Alphi Thompson said, do you have any advice regarding anyone dealing with post-backs damage and long COVID? 24 have been dealing with Vax injuries since 2021 and also long COVID now.
 My main issue is chest pain, cardiac chest pain, but no definitive diagnosis, but likely paracarditis with the way it represents POTS, palpitations, heart flutters, MCAS, histamine
 chronic GI issues tonight is what feels like autoimmune issues and had a positive IGN for a brilliant more. Okay, so that was probably typo. I'm trying my best to do all these right things.
 but I'm struggling severely still, bed and housebound. So I would just start with the basics with the foundation if you have an ROD. With the environment that's gonna be a major...
 factor, especially in regards to your EMF situation, because that can trigger or exacerbate or worsen the autoimmune symptoms, which
 Like the MCAS, some GISU can be worse and with autoimmune conditions. But in general, aside from that, the... There.
 is an immune system support protocol in my Twitter pin thread. There it should be towards the bottom, I believe. It's a gum road.
 If you just enter zero, you can download it for free. It's like seven pages of information that covers the both long COVID and the vaccine injuries.
 to like the immune system, the multiple mechanisms involved. I had read the thread on Twitter about the cardiovascular.
 management. Let me see if I can find that real quick.
kry okay so democrats said that case is a had a excavate
 COVID in 2022. It said monitor for iron access or deficiency. You want to maintain your zinc and copper balance preferably at a one to one.
 maintain sufficient magnesium. So about a 6.5 milligrams per desolider on an RBC magnesium test. Calcium sodium potassium intake.
 consume DHA and touring daily regularly because that's going to be very anti-inflammatory for the the hard specifically maintain sufficient thiamine intake so thiamine deficiency can result
 and not just neurological symptoms, but also cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. So there's multiple forms of berry berry, or that's like the name for thiamine deficiency, berry berry.
 There's like wet, berry berry. I forget all the different names for them, but it's covered under thiamine deficiency. Regular sun exposure for vitamin D.
 And with NCA, yes, you want to try to focus mostly on foods because I know that a lot of supplements and like some herbs can
 trigger some response in that regard, but it really depends on the individual sensitivity. So like just trying to focus on the foundational basics is going to be a major impact on
 and in regards to essentially all those symptoms, should off artificial light after sunset to maintain the autonomy and the cortisol balance, so that's gonna be another two major factors in regards to...
 those symptoms like cortisol can be very anti-inflammatory, malatonein as well and then you want those on the natural circadian rhythm rather than spiking or dropping or just being low all the time.
 Consumed sufficient vitamins A, vitamin A is very important for the immune system, just to keep it functioning properly without overactivation, vitamin E, vitamin K2, vitamin B.
 B2, volume B3, B6, biotin, folate, and B12. Protective factors like black cd oil may be a benefit for the cardiovascular system. Lodos aspirin pair.
 with glycine, and vitamin C may also be a benefit there. The aspirin can be a little bit of an issue for people with South.
 acidity, but cellulosellates are eliminated by the glycine detox pathway. So that's why I always recommend having a little bit of glycine if you ever take aspirin. Exercise becomes important.
 once nutritionally repeated as it does strengthen the cardiovascular system over exertion should be avoided in the meantime is because you don't want to put stress on an inflamed heart until it's managed a little bit better.
 Like, obviously, you're going for walks and everything, but like sprinting, uh, extremely heavy lifting where you're going, like, 100% intensity. Um, exercise in general should be, uh,
 very important, but you'll want to try to get those foundational factors in place before you do so just so your body is able to handle it even that stress. And then just like the active stress management.
 and also becomes important with Gabba support, a breathing practice, so Prana Yamawa or Breathwork, minimizing stressors in life and environment, so it's going to be highly individual there. Maintaining metabolic health.
 is also extremely important through dietary, light circadian, grounding, and lifestyle slash exercises exercise practices. The black seed oil and anoththal can also be very helpful in supporting metabolic health.
 But there should be uses tools rather than bandages. So the inocital is very helpful in regulating insulin and leptin and then regularly.
 building blood glucose levels as well. If those are elevated or low, it keeps them very stable. And then the gut microbiome is obviously going to be a major factor. But if you have symptoms of leaky gut,
 I would focus on managing that first with like Sunlight on the eyes and gut during the sunrise midday and sunset periods the
 Some people can be a little bit sensitive to things like bone broth, so I found meat stock or stews can be very helpful to get some of that glycine and glutamine into the digestive system a little bit better. A lot of
 a seafood is going to be very not just anti-inflammatory but it will have the amino acids necessary to repair the gut luck. Well, uh...
 depending on the specific, you just mention GIA issues. So depending on the specific symptoms, prebiotic starches can also be very helpful in regards to repopulating.
 uh... but it producing bacteria which has a positive effect on the intestinal whining um... and then the uh... i believe it's called the gut repair protocol uh... you may not need the full
 zero tolerance dietary framework unless like all of those factors trigger symptoms for you then by all means but there's a lot of good advice in there as well
 Yeah, that should cover a good amount. Like you want to try to target the foundation more so than individual symptoms because
 You're just going to be playing whack-a-mole pretty much in my experience. Whereas if you target the foundation, a lot of those symptoms will subside on the wrong.
 I'm sorry that all men's okay as part of the zero tolerance diet here from Mark. Yes. The, the sprouting and
 I can't imagine fermentation would have, they have been tasting very good, but sprouting is a very effective approach for that. That joint intending health would be good. Got a recovering ACL now and I'm trying.
 keep on trucking with my square progression. Okay awesome yeah I'm almost finished but here it made finally it did's been like a it didn't spend a crazy busy month but yeah I'll get that post as soon as possible
 And yes, mention and drink ridiculous amount of spring in mineral water while in cities. Drink probably 75% more than usual while in New York City. Oh man.
 It's such a stark difference in my water consumption and like how hydrating my mouth will feel from upstate and then being in in the city I just feel
 like I can't drink enough water when I'm in the city just because the EMF situation is just so dehydrating on the body. And then as soon as I leave the city, within a few hours to a day, it is.
 It returns back to normal where I'm not just pounding down water all day constantly. It's a very noticeable difference. It's interesting to observe. What do you with thought?
 Nature Boy said, what are your thoughts on SARS-CoV-2 and its benefits haven't been able to find much on your tutor? So, SARS-CoV-2 is more of a tonic in detox herb. I do including some of my herbal formulation.
 It's not something that I've talked about fairly often on Twitter or Patreon really. It's just more so something that I really enjoy the taste of like Jamaican Sarsal Proof.
 is it's very tasty. It has like almost a a sass of harass taste like groupier but yeah it's it's good for the kidney health.
 um... it's more so like a tonic or for general sense of energy uh... i do find it helpful and again like i said it tastes incredible uh... i will
 more than that it can cause a little bit of a bowel flushing effect if you can assume too much of it once. Andjo said wanted to
 Thank you, yes, and Grim for holding this Q&A is a guiser amazing. Thank you very much. KDVS said, I developed panic disorder a few months ago after an intensely painful experience.
 regular panic attacks these episodes last hours or days. I've been following the Gabber protocols in zero tolerance for two months, but progress is still slow. But any other protocols I should be reviewing are things to look into. I saw you say...
 the GAVERSES sector system takes the longest to recover. Did you mean weeks to months or more like years? So without the support of neural plasticity, the GAVERSES sector system,
 Like, for example, if you look at Benzo Diaz-Pen Recovery Patience, some of them don't ever return to normal. That's because they are not aware of the importance.
 of like nutritional surplus in regards to stress management and the co-factors needed for like repairing the body. And then also they become very fearful of anything that has any room.
 So even things like magnesium, which would be very helpful in their situation. They no longer want anything to do with just because they are so afraid of potential.
 rebound effect. But in my experience, really depends on, like if it's just more of a recent experience and it just develops.
 with in the last few months. It's not going. It could be like a 3 to 6 month timeline. Maximum could be a couple weeks that you start noticing major improvements. I don't. I couldn't imagine it's going to be.
 years unless it's like I don't want to say like any specific context but something extremely severe like someone passing away in front of your eyes something in that record
 I'm very sorry if that's what happened but yeah It really depends on what exactly you can follow for the game
 have protocols because I've outlined a lot of detail in some of them and I don't expect people to follow everything like every single detail but uh
 The more that you can do, the better in that regard. And then a lot of the herbal medicines are extremely helpful. Much...
 friends that I have been joking about Malundu Park on the Twitter timeline, but it was very helpful for one of my friends that was in a very similar situation where he started to develop.
 very severe panic attacks that again lasted for hours or days and maluku bark was very helpful in our guard naignolyabark and then just like the basic gab herbs
 Blue loaders can be very helpful integrating some of that magnesium, LT and I would bet knee. Oh yeah, for the sympathetic nervous system activation question as well, would bet knee was very helpful.
 when I was dealing symptoms very similar to that from CPTSD. It's a North American Commodore so it has a pretty extent.
 of history, but I've never really experienced any side effects. Hold on, my cat keeps rubbing up on me. I've never experienced any side effects when we would bet any. But...
 Some people can experience a little bit of a low blood pressure, so just be aware of that if you struggle with any issues like that but yeah the neurogenesis in general will vastly speed up
 the process of repairing the GABA receptor system just to summarize that whole van. It shouldn't take years upon years like it normally would.
 Okay, yeah. So ES had linked the shower filter that's the ultimate dual KDF shower filter. That's one that I had been using. Right?
 Like there's very expensive shower filters and like that was the middle point that I had found and come across rather than trying to invest a bunch of money into an apartment that I was living in or townhouse that I was living in.
 Um, Bell said I used to be in a similar position in panic attacks daily for days at a time and it definitely took a couple years to start seeing tangible results. Yeah, it really depends on-
 like it PTSD versus CPTSD if it's just one single event and then there's some factors that go into there. So like the state of the nervous system.
 and the body is a whole before that event occurred can play a major factor but yeah it can be very individual for sure.
 Yes, said a lot of issues like this can be a mix of psychological and biological. Yes, yes, it's very important as well. Where the psychological component of it is still present even after mineral, vitamin replacement, and so on.
 Plus it's important to work the trauma from the incident out. My favorite way to sneak out the deeper meaning of the incident through getting in a safe, peaceful setting and praying about it or trying to release the fear of it happening again to God. You're waived.
 can't really get maybe different, but if the core trauma is in dealt with, you will still experience the same symptoms until you become the sensitized to the flashbacks in trauma. That's 100% accurate, especially in my experience as well.
 I've talked about here and there on the Twitter timeline, but that shadow work and working through a lot of that trauma is going to be very, very important. That can look different for everyone, so it doesn't always have to be a religious context.
 therapy can be helpful for some people, breath work in Pranayama, some other therapy practices like bringing your sacred therapy can have a very profound emotional release.
 Some people require things like ketamine therapy that's perfectly fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's 100% accurate in that regard. You'll want to try to work through things as you rebuild your foundation.
 Bell said, Pranayama and grounding is basically necessary for me at this point. There are a lot of herbs that have also been helpful too, but the psychological could
 A psychological component is massive. I'm sorry you can late but glad to hear you found a leaf. Thanks for that greatly appreciate it. Will this be recorded anywhere? Yes, yes.
 I'm going to be making a, I'll probably post up an article just with like a Google Drive links just so I don't think that they Craig bought saved.
 the audio files long term. So I just want it to be in a safer place before it gets deleted. Dekie, what are your thoughts on an iconic illness that just felt like it?
 just switched on instantly like within 10 minutes going for fine to chronically deal with autonomic dysfunction shortness of breath. Lightheaded in 247 symptoms, my question is what mechanisms could be behind instant chronic illness? So it really depends on
 The situation, the environment, the context of what was going on before that happened. I had been working with someone that dealt with a very, very similar...
 situation but it rains to like severe full body neuro like neuropathy like
 nervous system feeling like it's on fire constantly buzzing throughout the entire nervous system. He's made a four recovery, but it took about, pick about a year. My kid's situation was very, very severe.
 with autonomic nervous system, things, it's, it typically doesn't take that long, but it really depends on the context. I would be looking at what the situation
 was at hand prior to that, trying to target some of those, and then just the same basic foundational advice really applies to any health condition. And then also as the side note, I would not...
 just look internally like within your self or your life, but also look towards your environment. Like if there's any cell towers that go up and you five G towers within your vicinity, on top of your building, if you live in an apartment.
 complex, those can also have a very very profound effect on your health and it can be like an instance which just feeling on top of the world one one day in edge.
 just absolutely terrible the next. So that's going to be another factor that you want to look into. Mold, mold is also another issue that can result in symptoms like that as well.
 I do quite a lot of the things you've suggested I do seem to have some paradoxical reaction to somethings or definitely try to implement everything. Yeah, with the MCAES.
 it makes things a little bit tricky. I'll go through my notes later today and then see if... I'm pretty sure I worked with a client that had...
 Very severe MCAS and working on managing the histamine symptoms Not like very targeted nutrition and then Some supplements that they had found they were
 or responsive to without any paradoxical reactions were helpful in that regard as well. But like I had mentioned earlier, the EMF situation, not just in-
 regards to mitochondrial function, but it also releases histamine for mass cells. That's one of the reasons why I had mentioned it. It's a very common issue in regards to who.
 Like people with the MCAS issue typically live in environments with a lot of EMF or major cities. There's not always the case, but it's something to be very mindful of.
 Bell, you're doing awesome. It's a really great feeling.
 and if you write about how do you realize everything that you were working with I would be more than happy to share some of that because
 more people need need to hear about these types of things it's not really something that's talked about in Like the health community online It's mostly physical health and fitness that a lot of people talk about and the
 mental and psychological or spiritual health really, really fall into the wayside just because it's less common than like gut issues or mild depression or anxiety or just to
 like that, like that severe traumatic response on the university system can, it's just a less, a lot less common. Yeah, I'd be more than happy to share anything that...
 you'd like to write about. Matt said, I can't find the tweet right now, but it was this picture I developed pretty gnarly F. and Tajda from the riff.
 period during my teens. The occasional experience to come back online after starting a dial in health, I believe you said you went from one to six ish when healing. Could you say more about that? Yeah, so...
 I was not aware of it at the time, but in retrospect there were a lot of indications that I was like there was low level brain damage occurring.
 I was in that very malnourished state and addicted to various types of drugs. Yeah, like during childhood I remember my visualization.
 ability was very very profoundly vivid and by the time I hit my teenage years that was all but gone pretty much and then especially after the brain injury there was
 no sense of it whatsoever. And then with the neurogenesis protocols and restoring my brain and nervousness to mouth, there was one of the first things that I noticed come back. Yeah.
 It may come in cycles for some people, but it's a very good sign that it's coming back on my mind more often. I believe the major factor is just neuro-inflammatory.
 like it has a very dulling or dampening effect on those types of processes within the brain or the mind technically. And then neuroplasticity.
 like the ability to really formulate complex thought with it. Like higher order thinking is very important in that regard as well I believe.
 Any tips for a night out? It's my buddy's B-day and she has an apartment in Brooklyn. Going to be up late, potentially on night. Lots of blue light. I'm going to start my glucose, P-M-D-D, experiment the night after a little bit.
 but sleep is not joke, I hate fucking with my circadian rhythm. I'm gonna take a nap beforehand, to avoid screens, ground before and after, and maintain my normal nutrition, and supplement stuff, probably bored caffeine for a bit after. I used to stay up for days at a time, but...
 Now I'm nervous, but I really socialize and that's part of being healthy too. Yeah, I would just have fun. Like you can bring a pair of light blocking glasses, but it might make you a little bit sleepy.
 Yeah, just focus on having fun and then like the main factor to building up the resilience with your foundation is You can have fun
 once in a while. More regularly than the average person without having to worry about all of your symptoms returning just from...
 one night out like a lot of the people in health twitter will talk about all i can't eat out it's own so at the art all be back to stage zero that that's like no resilience what's
 So it really depends on the point that you're at, but I would just focus on having fun. Like you said, the socialization is going to be really, really essential. I can't understand that enough. It's very, very important.

 Yeah, yeah, they can be definitely helpful tools. Okay, so Bell responded to the Decky chronic illness.

 of modern research on it, looking towards the traditional usage, history is as good as modern research in most regards because if you note, I think I mentioned in the last report.
 If you notice the modern research 99.9% of the time lines up with the traditional uses. So it's the systems that they had in place were very...
 They tend to be very accurate in my experience. This question is a possible for HPA access dysfunction to up- RETURNING
 DHD or Dan or Eulie hormones that are supposed to counteract the effects of the HD on the scalper body here, that's my guess so far to be honest. Yeah, that's what I had meant with DHD now.
 the direct cause but like a downstream effect of stress on the body. So like none of these other compounds or hormones have been tested for in the scalp.
 that I'm aware of. I've obviously I've looked through the entire PubMed library, but I've taken a fairly in-depth look into some of the other research.
 most of it is just in DHT or dihydroats, it there's seems to be very financial and monetary incentive behind
 a lot of the research for AirLoss and it's very strange to me. So yeah, I do believe the like cortisol on HCA access dysfunction is going to be.
 more upstream of the increased DHT that can be seen in some studies and other studies. Like people with low CRM DHT will have a...
 low DGT in the scalp, but they'll still experience this male pattern baldness. So there's not really any mainstream consensus they just keep. They see that drugs like the DGT inhibitor.
 there's working some people and then they're like, okay, so this is the cause. But it goes a little bit deeper than that I think. I'm still trying to success everything out because
 I've been more interested in some of the hormones recently. Get really good at pretending to take shot and dump it on the ground.
 I'm an expert. Yeah, yeah, having fun once in a while is as well worth any small health hit unless you're in a very severe state where
 like any small stressor will completely send you back to square one then I definitely agree with that. Does your brain ton-
 expire found one of the bottles back of my stack guessing about 10 to 12 months ago. I would say about two to three years. I've had really old bottles that um
 I've had for like four years they have been perfectly fine. I've tested them myself but just as a general guideline for a glistory extra actions about two to three years in general.
 senses. If it smells offer like, look strange, then obviously toss it, but in my personal experience, I haven't had that issue.
 But I also take a lot of care with the bottles. If it was completely unopened then it's very likely fine. Adding onto this I found the Kakao.
 They'll recommend it a while. You're a very helpful in providing space to process difficult thoughts though if you don't have sensitivity to the throw field bromide. Yes, Kakao is a It's a very powerful medicine surprisingly
 Um, I, I, I've, there was one point when I was initially beginning my, uh, health recovery process where I was eating literally ounces of rock, cow paste every single day. Like,
 I was tweeting about it very often at the time. This was like uh, only 18 or 2019. So a while back, but uh, it is definitely very helpful tool.
 6. How much caffeine can...
 How much can caffeine affect sleep even if taken 12 hours before? So my opinion about that has changed a little bit. I have written pretty long thread on caffeine a few years ago.
 and then I, no, it was like four or five years ago and then I repost it in 2021 on Twitter. So, there's some factors to go into that. It really depends on your...
 baseline stress level. So how stressed you are on a day-to-day. How sleep-to-prived you are. How you metabolize caffeine. So like some people have the genetics to metabolize it.
 very rapidly where I don't really last like two to four hours maybe. And then other people it can last six plus hours. So there's a genetic component to that. If you have like a
 sleep tracking device I would try that compare with caffeine and without caffeine how much impact it has on your sleep otherwise just go based on how you feel
 Like if you have energy waking up in the morning or if you feel groggy or like Usually one of the the frameworks that I use for Gaging how I feel because I don't use sleep tracking the bike
 either is how long it takes for me to like get out of bed and get my brain going in the morning. Some days when I don't get very much sleep that could be.
 like 10, 20 minutes, otherwise I'm just out of bed and getting started on the day. It can be longer for some people depending on the state of their body. But... Yeah.
 That is typically the main factor that I use to age how well I slept. But yeah, the caffeine sensitive.
 is very highly independent.
 And that said, what you're sharing sounds a lot like me, and I feel like I've been in a brand image, but I was somewhat into Nile or overwhelmed. A DMD on Patreon recently, but I saw a lot of overlap between your background and my own. Appreciate you.
 If you want to send me email or a message on here, I'll be more inclined to see it. I still need to catch up on these discord messages. I'll probably do messages. I'll just... I'll kind of get the shipment out.
 as soon as possible because I missed the period for February and I keep getting emails every single day about when it is so and so I'm going to be in stock so I'm going to get that back out. But uh...
 If you shoot me an email at contact at Grimsapothecary, that's Grimswith2ms.net or shoot me a message here, and I'll get back to you. Any advice for you?
 HPA access dysfunction other than the obvious. I believe I went up. I had mentioned something about that towards the beginning of this recording.
 You can go back and listen. I think I went pretty extensive on that one. Yeah, a bogeal or B.O.J.A. I don't know how to pronounce it.
 with okay okay, so yes responded to the caffeine question as well Carlos said how important
 is a spurty vitamin D lamp for someone living in the UK. I bought a red light therapy panel thinking that produces the melatonin to sleep, but I get the feeling that's not the case. Sperty lamps are expensive, but I'll spend the money if it's import.
 it. It really depends on your vitamin D levels and the degree of sun exposure you get during the spring and summer.
 And then I suppose your skin, your fritz Patrick's skin type will play a role as well because people with darker skin require more of the UV to stimulate the vitamin D.
 this is. So it really it's going to be more of an individual thing but if you get your vitally D levels tested and they're low during the winter then that would be an indication that you would be you would benefit from the vitally.
 I believe Blue Light Diet on Twitter. I believe he has a...
 guide that he has for sale. I think it's pretty cheap. I'll probably, I'll purchase it and take a look over it. But he recommends a...
 how to set up your own red light and UV devices I believe, and there may be a cheaper option in the spurty, because it's very pricey. It's very pricey, and that's the main factor in the apprehension I see.
 with the Spurty Vitamin D lamp. But it's been a very useful tool here in Upstate New York during the winners. Like this winner was I had made the mistake of taking away too many
 the console calls over the summer and then those could go on for like 4 to 6 hours max and then that was the entire town where like peaks on hours.
 I screwed myself over last summer, but it is what it is that the vitamin D lamp was very helpful to get through this winter. Do you know what you think about SLC68?
 for gene genetic results say have a faulty serotonin transporter and should avoid SSRIs. I think this means I should also avoid serotonergic substances, but they don't really understand the science. Last question, any idea where to start if I want to learn more about the body.
 Nero can and everything we discuss here. Okay, so... Alright, people are heading out. Thank you, ES for joining us on this call.
 Yeah, I'll wrap up the last few questions and then, and then we'll wrap this up. So I do.
 Personally, I have the SLC-64 gene as well. I seem to do fairly well in serotonergic substances, but I've never taken an SSI personally.
 I just talked with and worked with a lot of people who have and then people who have gone through the process of coming off of them. So that's why I like when I was 15, one of my friends warned me not.
 to like under any circumstances to take any SSRIs when I was going through the psychological or psych-met, psych-hat. All right. Thank you.
 Cyciatry medical system. Yeah, so you may have a little bit of an issue of clearing out.
 and I'm pretty sure that's the although I think there's a couple formats where the SLC 64
 Let's see. Yeah, if you find yourself sensitive to, so...
 to allergic compounds or something like that. And obviously try to avoid them or use them, not in excess. And then really focusing on gut health can make a major Wall.
 and that regard as well. So it's essentially like the genetics for an in-body SSRI. So the SSRIs, they try to think of a way to explain.
 this is simple as possible. They pretty much prevent the serotonin transporters from removing serotonin from the brain. And if you have low function of that transport,
 It's going to have a similar though to not the same extent degree of keeping serotonin within the brain. So if you find yourself sensitive to anything that increases serotonin.
 and by all means, but I haven't found that to be the case in my experience. Any idea where to start if I want to learn more about the body and neurochemistry?
 and everything we discuss here. I've been toying with, like, writing up the very basic guideline for a lot of the major neurotransmitters.
 I'll see what I can do. Like, I didn't read any books or textbooks or anything. I didn't take any classes. I just, I started reading studies and then discussions online forums in on-
 in my forums and then I would just like any word that I didn't understand. I would Google that. Look at the Wikipedia page or like any simpler explanations. And then I began piecing everything together. Obviously that's not a...
 very conducive. It was very time consuming, but yeah, I'll start working on something in that regard because I think that would be helpful.
 for a lot of newer people. In the meantime, Chad Gpt may be helpful. Like it's not always accurate, but it will give you like a basic rundown on what some of these things mean.
 or like just basic definitions. Like the more advanced information is you can just ask about here because it's in my experience Chad Gpt and a lot of those.
 AI chats are not 100% accurate. So I don't want to lead you astray with that, but it's good for basic information.
 Okay!
 But your opinions on something someone feeling worse after using Magnet and Sleep pad, I have the 20 girls version. It is too much for now. Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 20 girls is the maximum.
 option that they have that would definitely be way too much for most people I believe. I think I have the 10 Gauss. Maybe the 5 Gauss now actually.
 I think I had the 10 Galaxy and the Phoenix, but the 20 Gals may be a little bit too powerful, but like if you have springs on your
 on your, like if it's a spring box mattress, that could be amplifying the magnetic field to some degree, and then that could be one of the reasons I may depend on your environment.
 as well, but usually the magnetic or magnet, oh, you didn't even say magnetical. Yeah, if it's just a random magnetic sleep pad, then I'm not really positive because uh...
 the only one that I have experienced with is the Magnetical one. I know, I've got these cans. Get out. I'm sorry. Okay, so yeah, it is the Magnetical. Yeah. The...
 The 20 gals may be too much if none of those factors that I described are relevant to your situation. I would see if you could email them and like swap them out potentially. They may.
 have that option available, not positive? Actually, I think I remember a piece of paper that it came with, like with a lifetime warranty.
 I'm not positive. I just shoot them all in email and see what they say in that regard. It's my time said I have had a traumatic rednode attachment with no light.
 in the eye and they muscle and they control people, dilation is broken so that people permanently delayed. Cannot see through the eye, but register light and have a constant burning and pain as well as we can on that side of the body. Rule word program.
 What do you recommend for high health and specifically at a balanced light protocols as not wearing sunglasses is very difficult for example? That one, we can talk more about that one.
 it's going to be like a very extensive response there. And we're going to wrap this call up soon. Yeah, go ahead and shoot me a message and I'll get back to that one because that one's going to...
 That one's going to be a little bit more in depth and personalized. All right, so we'll check the chat.
 Okay, so Oh, it's my time said that there aren't miss Legendary trace
 said, what seafood do you consume? For example, I eat sourdeeings every day, but nothing other than that. I should probably introduce more. Sourdeeings are pretty solid. I ate a lot of salmon, and then a lot of fresh caught fish from around here. Oyster.
 scallops shrimp plants in a while. Yeah it's usually fresh water and then ocean water fish that my wife's father fishes.
 her father and her brother I'm going to start going fishing with them as well but yeah I tried to eat it as fresh possible just because it's available here on East Coast but really any seafood that you have the optionic.
 consume. It's better to do so. Yeah, it's starting. It's our terrible option though. They're very solid.
 Okay, so that was the questions in there All right, so the last question was Remarky the rooster I think
 Yeah, okay. Is there a basic stack that you would suggest everyone take every day across the board? No, it's gonna be very highly individualized depend on the diet your context your environment
 your day to day stress. How you respond to some things like with herbs specifically. In general, like the magnesium, thealthionine, and an acetal on black cedouille.
 are generally well received for the majority of people and they have very wide range and benefit. Other than that, everything is going to be more individualized.
 in very context-dependent. Yeah, I've read note about a lot of these contexts on Patreon, but if you have any like more specific questions, go ahead and ask them in this group.
 chat but yeah we're gonna wrap up the chat for today. All text yes and make sure that it's scheduled to be open
 for next week in 9 a.m. and then we'll continue doing these every week and then we'll go from there. Alright, thank you for joining everyone. It was very nice talking to you.
 All right, let's see, how do I turn off this recording?
